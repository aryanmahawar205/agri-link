# AgriLink: Comprehensive Agricultural Marketplace & Support Platform

AgriLink aims to support farmers by providing an integrated platform to access resources such as storage, machinery rental, crop testing, transportation, labor hiring, and market sales. This platform uses blockchain technology for larger-scale transactions, while utilizing regular payment gateways for smaller events.

## Problem Statement

Farmers often struggle with accessing essential services and resources like storage, machinery, crop testing, and labor. AgriLink bridges this gap by offering an easy-to-use platform to manage these services efficiently.

## Key Features

### Core MVP for Early Hackathons (Smaller Events)
For early hackathons and events, we will focus on a lightweight, user-friendly platform with the following features:
- **Signup/Login**: Easy registration and authentication for users.
- **Service Listings**: Listing of available services like storage spaces, machinery rentals, and clinics.
- **Booking & Payments**: Users can book services with integrated payments via **Razorpay**.
- **Blog/Community Forum**: A space for farmers to share experiences, tips, and stories.
- **Service Navigation**: A simple, intuitive UI allowing users to easily navigate through different sections.

### Blockchain Considerations for Bigger Hackathons (Advanced Features)
For larger hackathons with more complex needs, we plan to implement blockchain for secure and decentralized transactions:
- **Decentralized Ledger**: Blockchain records all service purchases and transactions.
- **Smart Contracts**: Agreements between farmers and service providers are managed through smart contracts, ensuring transparency and automation.
- **Wallet System**: A blockchain-based wallet will replace traditional payment systems like Razorpay, supporting secure and traceable payments.
  
**Blockchain Platform**: We will use **Ethereum** for the larger-scale hackathon due to its widespread adoption, smart contract support, and security features. **Polygon** or **Solana** could also be considered for cost-effectiveness and scalability.

### Verification System
We will integrate a **verification system** for users:
- **OCR for Document Verification**: Optical Character Recognition (OCR) will be used to verify government documents like IDs, licenses, and certifications.
- **Manual Admin Approval**: Admins will manually approve the verification for certain services (e.g., service providers).
- **Who Needs Verification**: Service providers (e.g., storage owners, machinery rental, transport services) will need verification, while general users may not be required to verify unless they become service providers in the future.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: 
    - **React.js** / **Next.js** (for fast, dynamic user interfaces)
    - **Web3.js** / **Ethers.js** (for blockchain interaction in the frontend)
- **Backend**:
    - **Node.js** with **Express.js** / **Django**
    - **Blockchain integration** using **Web3.js** for Ethereum transactions
- **Database**: 
    - **PostgreSQL** for structured data (user profiles, service details, etc.)
    - **Firebase** for real-time features (e.g., messaging, notifications)
- **Payment Gateways**: 
    - **Razorpay** for regular payments (smaller hackathons)
    - **Blockchain Wallet** for larger-scale transactions (Ethereum, Polygon)
- **Hosting**:
    - **AWS** or **Vercel** (Frontend and Backend hosting)
    - **Infura** / **Alchemy** (for Ethereum blockchain interactions)

## Installation Guide

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash

5. **For Blockchain Setup**:
    - Install necessary libraries for blockchain interaction:
      ```bash
      npm install web3 ethers
      ```
    - Set up an Ethereum wallet (e.g., MetaMask) and obtain testnet or mainnet Ethereum tokens for testing.
    - Integrate with Infura or Alchemy for Ethereum node access.

## Contributing

Feel free to fork the project, open issues, and send pull requests. We welcome all contributions, especially those that can help with blockchain integration and verification processes. 

### Team & Timeline

- **Team**: A small group of developers, designers, and blockchain specialists.
- **Timeline**: We aim to complete the first MVP before the upcoming hackathons (targeting 2â€“3 months).

## Future Plans
- **Mobile App**: Develop a mobile version for farmers who prefer using smartphones.
- **Additional Blockchain Support**: Explore adding other blockchains such as **Polygon** or **Solana** for lower transaction costs.
- **Advanced Verification**: Implement a more robust verification system using facial recognition or AI-based document analysis.
